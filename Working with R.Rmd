# Data Types

## Vectors

-   The simplest data structure in R is a **vector**

-   An ordered collection of elements

-   Four common types of vectors:

    -   Numeric:

            x <- 10.2
            x

    -   Integer:

            y <- 1:5
            y

    -   Character

            name <- "Johnny Appleseed"
            name

    -   Logical.

            a <- TRUE
            a

    -   How about ?

            name <- Johnny

How to identify data type?

    class(x)
    mode(x)

## Factors

-   Categorical data (nominal or ordinal) are most easily stored as a\
    different class of data called factors

-   Non-numerical vectors are recognized as factors

        a <- c("female", "male", "female", "male")
        a

        a <- factor(a)
        a

-   Type Conversion

    -   Group of functions in R called coercion functions that just change objects from one type to another

            x <- 1:10
            x

            x <- as.character(x)
            x

All functions can be found

    apropos("^as\\.")

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Data Structures

-   Data in R are stored in data structures (also known as data objects)

-   Most common data structures:

    -   Vectors

    -   Matrices

    -   Arrays

    -   Data Frames

    -   Lists

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------

        ## Data Structures Overview

        -   Matrices are similar to vectors, but have two dimensions

        <!-- -->

            m <- matrix(1:30, nrow = 3)
            m

        ### 

        -   Arrays are similar to matrices, but can have more than two dimensions

        <!-- -->

            a <- array(1:27, dim = c(3, 3, 3))
            a

        *\*\* vectors, matrices, and arrays is that they can only store one type of data at once*

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    -   Data frames are two-dimensional objects similar to matrices

    -   A data frame can contain columns

    -   Data frames are similar to data sets used in other languages

            dat <- read.csv("./data/marketing.csv")

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------

        -   **Lists** are similar to vectors, in that they are an ordered collection of elements

        -   With **lists**, the elements can be other data objects

        <!-- -->

            L <- list("This is the first element in our list", 1:10, dat)

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Vectors

Elements are spaced by exactly 1, just separate the values of the first and last elements with a colon

    1:5

    seq(-10, 10, 2)

    rep(4, 5)

more fun with rep:

    x <- 1:3
    rep(x, 4)

    rep(x, each = 4)

build a vector combining different elements

    c(2, 1, 5, 100, 2)

You can also name them:

    c(a = 2, b = 1, c = 5, d = 100, e = 2)

a vector of a certain length

    x <- numeric(50)
    x

Logical vectors: very useful in R for indexing:

    x <- 1:10
    x>5

### Quiz:

What is the proportion of values in x that were greater than 3

    mean(x>3)

## Matrices, arrays, and lists

To generate a matrix, the matrix function can be used

    m <- matrix(1:15, nrow = 5)
    m

change the filling order, you can use the byrow argument

    m <- matrix(1:15, nrow = 5, byrow = TRUE)
    m

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A similar function is available for higher-order arrays, called array

    a <- array(1:30, dim = c(5, 3, 2))
    a

Lists are simple to create in R-just combine the individual elements with the list function

    l <- list(x, name, m)
    l

### Quiz

Conver x to a list

    as.list(x)

# Data import, and data export

## Working directory

Try reading in a data file with this command

    pop <- read.csv("../data/us_pop.csv")

*"\# cannot open file 'us_pop.csv': No such file or directory "*

the file is not in R's **working directory**

We first need to find the current work directory:

    getwd()

Let's brows the directory:

    list.files()
    or 
    list.files('../data')

\*The ".." in a file path means "**go up one level**".\
Change the directory:

    setwd("C:/Users/Morteza/Documents/RStudio")
    #C:/Users/Morteza/Documents/RStudio/Intro to R
    #C:/Users/Morteza/Documents/RStudio

## Reading text files

-   A data frame is probably the most common data structure that you will use for storing what you might call data sets

-   The easiest way to create a data frame is to read in data from a file

-   Let's open the data in text editor first

        pop <- read.csv("../data/us_pop.csv")
        pop

-   If you encounter files with a *semicolon separator* and a decimal comma, use the **read.csv2** or **read_csv2** function.

-   what if the separator is something else?

        flow <- read.table("../data/flow_2006_summary.txt", header = TRUE)
        head(flow)

    -   Read.csv uses another function called read.table. Take a look and discuss the differences.

-   The easiest approach to handling missing values

        which(is.na(flow$discharge))

<!-- -->

    flow

Ask a few things about any new file:

1.  Is a header present (header argument)?\
2.  What is the field separator (sep argument)?\
3.  What symbol is used for decimals (dec argument)?\
4.  What symbol is used for missing values (na.strings argument)?

### Example 1

-   Open Ni ec50s.txt and first answer the questions

        ni <- read.table("../data/Ni_ec50s.txt", header = TRUE)
        ni

-   you can speciafy a separator

        ni <- read.table("../data/Ni_ec50s.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "nt")
        ni

    ### Excercise.

    Read the us_pop.txt file and show the imported data.

        pop <- read.table("../data/us_pop.txt", header = TRUE)
        head(pop)

-   Note that we did not need to specify a separator, since one or more white space characters (spaces, in this case) are interpreted as a separator

-   How about other file types? spreed sheet?

## Reading spreadsheet files

-   Two options for getting them into R

    -   Export to text files

        -   Data can be saved (or perhaps exported) directly from spreadsheet\
            programs as a text file, e.g. as \\Formatted Text (Space delimited)" (\*.prn) in Excel, or, better, as comma-separated values (\*.csv)

    -   Use add-on package

        -   There are at least four packages

        -   gdata, XLConnect, xlsx, and readxl

    -   readxl is the easiest one

            library(readxl)
            h1 <- read_excel("../data/biohydrogen.xlsx", sheet = 2)
            head(h1)

## Create data frames manually

So far, we created a data frame by importing data from a file.

Some times, we need to create a dataframe in our codes based on variables.

First, we create two columns: Group and Mass:

    group <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")
    mass <- rnorm(4, mean = 50)

Then, we use data.frame to define the dataframe:

    dat <- data.frame(id = group, mean = mass)
    dat

Let's play with the data frame:

-   Find the columns name

<!-- -->

    names(dat)

-   assign new names to the columns

<!-- -->

    names(dat) <- c("date", "mass")
    dat

-   you can also give names to rows (useful for indexing data )

<!-- -->

    dat <- data.frame(id = group, mean = mass, row.names = c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
    dat

### Working with data frames

The data in a data frame will be used in some type of analysis or plotting procedure

First you need to do some form of data checking

    h2 <- read.csv("../data/biohydrogen.csv")

One option is to use summary:

    summary(h2)

The functions unique(), sort(), and range() can also be useful for checking data

    unique(h2$reactor)
    unique(h2$date)

Common problems in data:

-   Numeric columns stored as character data

-   Impossible values

-   Typos or inconsistent letter case in character data

-   Typos in numeric data (decimal place errors)

-   Numeric missing value codes (999, -999, 0)

-   Incorrect column names

-   Merged columns

In order to use data frame data for a plot or analysis, you should be able to select and identify specific columns within data frames:

    h2 <- read.csv("../data/biohydrogen.csv")
    names(h2)

The \$ notation just uses a \$ between the data frame name and column name to specify a particular column

    h2$vol

then you can use it as a vector:

    mean(h2$vol)

remove the NA values:

    mean(na.omit(h2$vol))

Create a new column:

    h2$vol.L <- h2$vol/1000
    head(h2)

### Exercise

Let's read conc.h2 column and remove the NA values.

    h2$conc.h2
    na.omit(h2$conc.h2)

**Question:** How can we remove all the NA from a dataframe?

Work with a smaller subset of a dataframe:

    pres <- read.csv("../data/presidents.csv")
    pres19 <- pres[pres$first > 1899, ]
    p <- pres19
    head(p)
    names(p)[3:4] <- c("dob", "dod")

you can also rename a column using dplyr library:

    library(dplyr)
    p <- rename(p, dob = birth, dod = death)
    head(p)

## Writing data to files

The function **write.table** (or the related function **write.csv**) is the best function for writing out data frames.

    args(write.table)

    write.table(h2, "../output/h2.txt")

Or

    write.csv(h2, "../output/h2.csv", row.names = FALSE)

write.csv is recommended :)

# Data manipulation

## Indexing and subsetting

-   Extract specific parts of a data structure

-   Indexing (also known as subscripting) can also be used to change or\
    add elements to a data structure

-   Indexing is generally done using square brackets

        x <- c(5, 1, 12, 8)
        x[3]

    For the 1st through 3rd observation:

        x[1:3]

    While this returns all but the 4th observation:\

        x[-4]

    let's play with it:

        x[x<5]
        x<5

    Indexing can also be used to change the value of elements

        x[2] <- 100
        x

    And you can change its size by assinging a value to a non-existing index:

        x <- c(5, 1, 3, 8)
        x[8] <- 10

    Practice:

        flow <- read.csv("../data/flow_2006_summary.csv")
        dim(flow)

        head(flow)

    We want only the first five rows and first two columns

        flow[1:5, 1:2]

        flow[1:5, c("month", "discharge")]

How about five rows:

    flow[1:5, ]

Or only one column:

    flow[1:5, "site.id"]

We can apply relational expressions using indexing:

Let's pull out only those rows with discharge below, say, the 25th percentile

    flow[flow$discharge<13105.9, ]

### Subsetting

Subsetting is used to select a subset of a vector:

    subset(flow, discharge<13105.9)

'and' expression:

    subset(flow, discharge>13105.9 & site.id == 4232730)

'or' expression:

    subset(flow, month == "May" | month == "Jun" | month == "Jul")

    subset(flow, month %in% c("May", "Jun", "Jul"))

**Extra tips:** There are two functions in the dplyr package that can replace most or all of the extracting that you might otherwise do with indexing and the subset function.

    library(tidyverse)
    filter(flow, discharge < 13105.9)
    filter(flow, discharge>13105.9, site.id == 4232730)
    filter(flow, discharge>13105.9 & site.id == 4232730)
    filter(flow, month %in% c("May", "Jun", "Jul"))

\*\* The slice and filter functions differ from indexing the [ ] in an important way: they only work on rows.

To select columns, you need to use the select function:

    wind <- read.csv("../data/ave_wind_us.csv")
    head(wind)
    dplyr::select(wind, jan)

Indexing of matrices and arrays is similar to vectors and data frames

    m <- matrix(rnorm(25), nrow = 5)
    m

    m[3, 2]

    m[m<10] <- NA

### Sorting data and locating observations

For a single vector, this is done with the function sort

    x <- rnorm(5)
    x

    sort(x)

we use 'order' function to sort the entire data frame by one column?

    pres19[order(pres19$birth, pres19$name, decreasing = TRUE), ]

what does this do?

    pres19[order(-pres19$birth, pres19$name), ]

Sometimes it is important to know where data reside in the original data\
structure

    match(7917.205, flow$discharge)

I might use match to find the location of the element with the maximum value:

    match(max(flow$discharge), flow$discharge)

The which function, on the other hand, will return all locations that meet the criterion or criteria

    which(flow$discharge<20000 & flow$discharge>10000)

### Combining data frames and matrices

Data frames (or vectors or matrices) often need to be combined for analysis or plotting\
rbind() (row bind), and merge() are the popular function for cimbining dataframes.\

    m <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3)
    m

    mm <- rbind(m, 1:4)
    mm

The rbind() function can be used in the same way for data frames

    pop <- read.csv("../data/us_pop.csv")
    gdp <- read.csv("../data/us_gdp.csv")

    us <- merge(pop, gdp, by = "year")

Notice that us does not have rows for all the years that are present in the gdp data frame, because most of them didn't have a matching year in pop\
If you want to keep all rows regardless, use all = TRUE.

    us <- merge(pop, gdp, by = "year", all = TRUE)
    dfsumm(us)

**Bonus:** what if the variables you would like to merge by don't have the same name in both data frames?

## **Functions**

**When would you want to call the same code over and over again? What benefit does that have in programming?**

Similar to the way we can use `for` loops as a means of performing repetitive tasks on a series of objects, we can also create functions to perform repetitive tasks. Within a function, we can write a large block of action and then call the function whenever we want to use it.

Let's write some pseudocode, which is code that R will not run successfully, but illustrates the basic idea without worrying about correct syntax:

    # Define the function name and the requirements it needs.
        # Perform actions.
        # Optional: Return output.

A function is defined like this:

    function_name  <- function(arguments):
        # Do things here.
        return value

Create a function to print squares of numbers in a list:

```{r}

print_square <- function(a) {
   for(i in 1:a) {
      b <- i^2
      print(b)
   }
}
```

## Calling a Function

    # Call the function new.function supplying 6 as an argument.
    new.function(6)

\

**apply()** is primarily used to avoid explicit uses of loop constructs. It is the most basic of all collections can be used over a matrice.

This function takes 3 arguments:\
\* an array or matrix

-   An array or matrix

-   Margin:

    -   1: the manipulation is performed on rows

    -   2: the manipulation is performed on columns

    -   c(1,2): the manipulation is performed on rows and columns

-   FUN: which function to apply. Built functions like mean, median, sum, min, max and even user-defined functions

**Example**

    m1 <- matrix(C<-(1:10),nrow=5, ncol=6)
    m1

    a_m1 <- apply(m1, 2, sum)
    a_m1

**lapply():** is useful for performing operations on list objects and returns a list object of same length of original set

    movies <- c("SPYDERMAN","BATMAN","VERTIGO","CHINATOWN")
    movies_lower <-lapply(movies, tolower)
    str(movies_lower)

**sapply() function:** sapply() function does the same job as lapply() function but returns a vector.

```{r}
dt <- cars
lmn_cars <- lapply(dt, min)
smn_cars <- sapply(dt, min)
lmn_cars
```

## 

OPTIONAL 1

We can create a custom function and apply to the data. For example, create a function to compute the average of the minimum and maximum of the vector.

```{r}
avg <- function(x) {  
  ( min(x) + max(x) ) / 2}
fcars <- sapply(dt, avg)
fcars
```

there are other functions:

**tapply()** It is a very useful function that lets you create a subset of a vector and then apply some functions to each of the subset

```{r}
data(iris)
tapply(iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Species, median)
```

**slice vector:** We can use lapply() or sapply() interchangeable to slice a data frame.

Let's create below_average() function to return a vector that only contains the values that are strictly above the average. Then we use lapply and sapply to slice the vector.

    dt <- cars
    below_ave <- function(x) {  
        ave <- mean(x) 
        return(x[x > ave])
    }
    dt_s<- sapply(dt, below_ave)
    dt_l<- lapply(dt, below_ave)
    identical(dt_s, dt_l)

-   compare both results with the identical()
