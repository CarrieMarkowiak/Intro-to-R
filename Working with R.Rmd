# **Learning Objectives**

*In this lesson, we will go over the following:*

-   Define different data types and data structures in R.

-   Introduce dplyr and use it

-   Data import and exports (csv, table, readxl)

-   Working with data frames.

-   Data manipulation

-   Functions![](images/Capture.jpg){width="1000" height="10"}

# Data Types

## Vectors

-   The simplest data structure in R is a **vector**

-   An ordered collection of elements

-   Four common types of vectors:

    -   Numeric:

        ```{r}

        x <- 10.2
        x
        ```

    -   Integer:

        ```{r}
        y <- 1:5
        y
        ```

    -   Character

        ```{r}

        name <- "Johnny Appleseed"
        name
        ```

    -   Logical.

        ```{r}
        a <- TRUE
        a
        ```

    -   How about ?

        ```{r}

        #name <- Johnny
        ```

How to identify data type?

```{r}
class(x)
mode(x)
```

![](images/Capture.jpg){width="1000" height="10"}

## Factors

-   Categorical data (nominal or ordinal) are most easily stored as a\
    different class of data called *factors*

-   Non-numerical vectors are recognized as factors

    ```{r}
    a <- c("female", "male", "female", "male")
    a

    a <- factor(a)
    a
    ```

<!-- -->

-   Type Conversion

    -   Group of functions in R called *coercion* functions that just change objects from one type to another

        ```{r}
        x <- 1:10
        x

        x <- as.character(x)
        x
        ```

All functions can be found

```{r}
apropos("^as\\.")
```

![](images/Capture.jpg){width="1000" height="10"}

# Data Structures

-   Data in R are stored in data structures (also known as data objects)

-   Most common data structures:

    -   Vectors

    -   Matrices

    -   Arrays

    -   Data Frames

    -   Lists

![](images/Capture.jpg){width="1000" height="10"}

## Data Structures Overview

-   **Matrices** are similar to vectors, but have two dimensions

    ```{r}
    m <- matrix(1:30, nrow = 3)
    m
    ```

<!-- -->

-   **Arrays** are similar to matrices, but can have more than two dimensions

    ```{r}
    a <- array(1:27, dim = c(3, 3, 3))
    a
    ```

*\*\* vectors, matrices, and arrays is that they can only store one type of data at once*

-   **Dataframes:**

    -   Data frames are two-dimensional objects similar to matrices

    -   A data frame can contain columns

    -   Data frames are similar to data sets used in other languages

-   **Lists**

    -   They are similar to vectors, in that they are an ordered collection of elements

        -   With **lists**, the elements can be other data objects

    ```{r}
    L <- list("This is the first element in our list", 1:10)
    ```

![](images/Capture.jpg){width="1000" height="10"}

## Vectors

Elements are spaced by exactly 1, just separate the values of the first and last elements with a colon

```{r}
1:5

seq(-10, 10, 2)

rep(4, 5)
```

more fun with rep:

```{r}
x <- 1:3
rep(x, 4)

rep(x, each = 4)
```

build a vector combining different elements

```{r}
c(2, 1, 5, 100, 2)
```

You can also name them:

```{r}
c(a = 2, b = 1, c = 5, d = 100, e = 2)
```

a vector of a certain length

```{r}
x <- numeric(50)
x
```

Logical vectors: very useful in R for indexing:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x>5
```

### Challenge:

What is the proportion of values in x that were greater than 3:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
mean(x>3)
```

## Matrices, arrays, and lists

To generate a matrix, the matrix function can be used

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:15, nrow = 5)
m
```

change the filling order, you can use the byrow argument

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:15, nrow = 5, byrow = TRUE)
m
```

A similar function is available for higher-order arrays, called array

```{r}
a <- array(1:30, dim = c(5, 3, 2))
a
```

Lists are simple to create in R-just combine the individual elements with the list function

```{r}
l <- list(m,a)
l
```

### Challenge:

Create a vector, called x, as numbers between 10 to 20 . Convert x to a list called ll.

```{r}
x <- 10:20
ll <- as.list(x)
```

    as.list(x)

![](images/Capture.jpg){width="1000" height="10"}

# Data import, and data export

## What is the current working directory?

Try reading in a data file with this command

    marketing <- read.csv("Intro-to-R/data/marketing.csv")

[cannot open file 'Intro-to-R/data/marketing.csv': No such file or directory]{.ul}

the file is not in R's **working directory**

We first need to find the current work directory:

```{r}
getwd()
```

Let's brows the directory:

    list.files()
    or 
    list.files('../data')

\*The ".." in a file path means "**go up one level**".\
Change the directory:

    setwd("C:/Users/Morteza/Documents/RStudio")
    #C:/Users/Morteza/Documents/RStudio/Intro-to-R
    #C:/Users/Morteza/Documents/RStudio

## Data frames and reading text files

-   A data frame is probably the most common data structure that you will use for storing what you might call data sets

-   The easiest way to create a data frame is to read in data from a file

-   Let's open the data in text editor first

    ```{r}
    marketing <- read.csv("./data/marketing.csv")
    marketing
    ```

-   If you encounter files with a *semicolon separator* and a decimal comma, use the **read.csv2** or **read_csv2** function.

-   What if the separator is something else?

    ```{r}
    marketing_txt <- read.table("./data/marketing.txt", header = TRUE)
    head(marketing_txt)
    ```

    ```{r}
    tail(marketing_txt)
    ```

    -   Read.csv uses another function called read.table. Take a look and discuss the differences.

    ![](images/Capture.jpg){width="1000" height="10"}

Ask a few things about any new file:

1.  Is a header present (header argument)?\
2.  What is the field separator (sep argument)?\
3.  What symbol is used for decimals (dec argument)?\
4.  What symbol is used for missing values (na.strings argument)?

### Example

-   Open marketing_sep and first answer the questions

-   You should specify a separator

    ```{r}
    marketing_sep <- read.table("./data/marketing_sep.txt", header = TRUE,sep="|")
    head(marketing_sep)
    ```

    ### Challenge: Read the titanic.txt file and show the imported data.

        titanic <- read.table("./data/titanic.txt", header = TRUE,sep="|")
        head(titanic)

## Reading spreadsheet files

-   Two options for getting them into R

    -   Export to text files

        -   Data can be saved (or perhaps exported) directly from spreadsheet\
            programs as a text file, e.g. as \\Formatted Text (Space delimited)" (\*.prn) in Excel, or, better, as comma-separated values (\*.csv)

    -   Use add-on package

        -   There are at least four packages

        -   gdata, XLConnect, xlsx, and readxl

    -   readxl is the easiest one

        ```{r}
        library(readxl)
        drinks <- read_excel("./data/drinks.xlsx",sheet=2)
        head(drinks)
        ```

**Optional: excel_sheets function**

Read all worksheets in an excel file:

```{r}
path <- "./data/drinks.xlsx"
sheets <- excel_sheets(path)
for (sh in sheets){
  print(head(read_excel(path, sheet = sh)))
}
```

## Create data frames manually

-   So far, we created a data frame by importing data from a file.

-   Some times, we need to create a dataframe in our codes based on variables.

First, we create two columns: Group and Mass:

```{r}
group <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")
mass <- rnorm(4, mean = 50)
```

Then, we use data.frame to define the dataframe:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(id = group, mean = mass)
df
```

-   Name of the columns:

    ```{r}
    names(df)
    ```

<!-- -->

-   Assign new names to the columns

    ```{r}
    names(df) <- c("date", "mass")
    df
    ```

![](images/Capture.jpg){width="1000" height="10"}

# Working with data frames

## dplyr package

-   the most popular package in R for data manipulation

![](images/logo.png){width="154"}

### **Installation**

```{r}
# The easiest way to get dplyr is to install the whole tidyverse:
#install.packages("tidyverse")
# Alternatively, install just dplyr:
#install.packages("dplyr")
```

### **Usage:**

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

The data in a data frame will be used in some type of analysis or plotting procedure

First you need to do some form of data checking

```{r}
drinks <- read.csv("./data/drinks.csv")
head(drinks)
```

One option is to use summary:

```{r}
summary(drinks)
```

```{r}
names(drinks)
```

The functions unique() can also be useful for checking data

```{r}
#finding the unique recprds
unique(drinks)
```

**Common problems in data:**

-   Numeric columns stored as character data

-   Impossible values

-   Typos or inconsistent letter case in character data

-   Typos in numeric data (decimal place errors)

-   Numeric missing value codes (999, -999, 0)

-   Incorrect column names

-   Merged columns

In order to use data frame data for a plot or analysis, you should be able to select and identify specific columns within data frames:

### **Access to a column**

The \$ notation just uses a \$ between the data frame name and column name to specify a particular column

```{r}
drinks$continent
```

then you can use it as a vector:

```{r}
unique(drinks$continent)
```

Access to multiple columns:

```{r}
df <- select(drinks, country, continent)
```

```{r}
head(df)
```

### **Rename a column (rename function):**

```{r}
drinks <- rename(drinks, litres=total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, beer=beer_servings, win=wine_servings,spirit=spirit_servings )
head(drinks)
```

### **Add a new column:**

```{r}
drinks$litersML <- drinks$litres*100
head(drinks)
```

### **Remove a column:**

```{r}
#we use select function with -at the beginning of columns
drinks <- select(drinks,-country)
```

### Work with a smaller subset of a dataframe:

```{r}
ufo <- read.csv("./data/ufo.csv")
names(ufo)
```

```{r}
unique(ufo$State)
```

```{r}
ufo_NY <- ufo[ufo$State == "NY", ]
head(ufo_NY)
```

```{r}
names(ufo_NY)[1:2] <- c("CTY", "CLRS")
```

## Writing data to files

The function **write.csv** is the best function for writing out data frames.

```{r}
write.csv(ufo_NY, "./output/ufo_NY.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

**Bonus (write.table):**

```{r}
args(write.table)
write.table(ufo_NY, "./output/ufo_NY.txt")
```

# Data manipulation

## Indexing and subsetting

-   Extract specific parts of a data structure

-   Indexing (also known as subscripting) can also be used to change or\
    add elements to a data structure

-   Indexing is generally done using square brackets

    ```{r}
    x <- c(5, 1, 12, 8)
    x[3]
    ```

-   For the 1st through 3rd observation:

    ```{r}
    x[1:3]
    ```

-   While this returns all but the 4th observation:

    ```{r}
    x[-4]
    ```

-   let's play with it:

    ```{r}
    x[x<5]
    x<5
    ```

-   Indexing can also be used to change the value of elements

    ```{r}
    x[2] <- 100
    x
    ```

    ## **Practice:**

    Read titanic dataset and do the following operations:

    ```{r}
    titanic <- read.csv("./data/titanic.csv")
    dim(titanic)

    head(titanic)
    ```

    We want only the first five rows and first two columns

    ```{r}
    titanic[1:5, 1:2]

    titanic[1:5, c("Name", "Sex")]
    ```

How about five rows:

```{r}
titanic[1:5, ]
```

-   We can apply relational expressions using indexing:

Let's pull out only those rows with age below, say, 30:

```{r}
titanic[titanic$Age<30, ]
```

## Subsetting

Subsetting is used to select a subset of a vector:

```{r}
subset(titanic, Age<30)
```

'and' expression:

```{r}
subset(titanic, Age<30 & Sex == "female")
```

'or' expression:

```{r}
subset(titanic, Age<30 | Age > 60)
```

**Extra tips:** There are two functions in the dplyr package that can replace most or all of the extracting that you might otherwise do with indexing and the subset function.

    library(tidyverse)
    filter(titanic, Age < 30)
    filter(titanic, Age < 30, Sex == "female")
    filter(titanic,Age < 30 & Sex == "female")
    filter(titanic, Embarked %in% c("C", "S"))

\*\* The slice and filter functions differ from indexing the [ ] in an important way: they only work on rows.

## Sorting data and locating observations

For a single vector, this is done with the function sort

```{r}
x <- rnorm(5)
x

sort(x)
```

we use 'order' function to sort the entire data frame by one column?

```{r}
titanic[order(titanic$Age, titanic$Sex, decreasing = TRUE), ]
```

**Challenge: what does this do?**

    titanic[order(-titanic$Age, titanic$Sex), ]

### **Locating**

Sometimes it is important to know where data reside in the original data\
structure

```{r}
match("56", titanic$Age)
```

The *which function*, on the other hand, will return all locations that meet the criterion or criteria

```{r}
which(titanic$Age == 56 )
```

### Combining data frames (rbind(), merge())

Data frames (or vectors or matrices) often need to be combined for analysis or plotting\

```{r}
m1 <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3)
m1

m2 <- 1:4
m2

```

```{r}
#combine them
mm <- rbind(m1,m2)
mm
```

The rbind() function can be used in the same way for data frames

```{r}
beer <- read.csv("./data/beer.csv")
head(beer)
```

```{r}
wine <- read.csv("./data/wine.csv")
head(wine)
```

We want to merge them based on the country:

```{r}
beer_wine <- merge(beer, wine, by = "country")
```

If beer does not have rows for all the country that are present in the wine data frame, then most of them didn't have a matching country in pop\
If you want to keep all rows regardless, use all = TRUE.

    us <- merge(pop, gdp, by = "year", all = TRUE)
    dfsumm(us)

**Bonus:** what if the variables you would like to merge by don't have the same name in both data frames?

## **Handling Missing Values**

-   **Objective:** Know how to handle null and missing values.\

-   Sometimes, values will be missing from the source data or as a byproduct of manipulations. It is very important to detect missing data. Missing data can:

    -   Make the entire row ineligible to be training data for a model.

    -   Hint at data-collection errors.

    -   Indicate improper conversion or manipulation.

    -   Actually not be missing --- it sometimes means "zero," "false," "not applicable," or "entered an empty string."

-   For example,

```{r}
# vector with missing data
x <- c(1:4, NA, 6:7, NA)
x
```

```{r}
#find out if a vector has missing values
is.na(x)

```

```{r}
#identify the location
which(is.na(x))

```

Exclude missing values

```{r}
mean(x)
# excluding NA values will calculate the mathematical operation for all non-missing values
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Find complete cases in a dataframe:

```{r}
# subset with complete.cases to get complete cases
ufo <- read.csv("./data/ufo.csv")
complete.cases(ufo)
ames[complete.cases(ufo), ]
```

or we can remove them:

```{r}
na.omit(ufo)
```

**Exercises:**

-   How many missing values are in the titanic?

-   Calculate mean value for Age

-   Omit all rows containing missing values?

# **Functions**

When would you want to call the same code over and over again? What benefit does that have in programming?

Similar to the way we can use `for` loops as a means of performing repetitive tasks on a series of objects, we can also create functions to perform repetitive tasks. Within a function, we can write a large block of action and then call the function whenever we want to use it.

Let's write some pseudocode, which is code that R will not run successfully, but illustrates the basic idea without worrying about correct syntax:

    # Define the function name and the requirements it needs.
        # Perform actions.
        # Optional: Return output.

A function is defined like this:

    function_name  <- function(arguments):
        # Do things here.
        return value

Create a function to print squares of numbers in a list:

```{r}

print_square <- function(a) {
   for(i in 1:a) {
      b <- i^2
      print(b)
   }
}
```

## Calling a Function

    # Call the function new.function supplying 6 as an argument.
    new.function(6)

\
**apply()** is primarily used to avoid explicit uses of loop constructs. It is the most basic of all collections can be used over a matrice.

This function takes 3 arguments:\
\* an array or matrix

-   An array or matrix

-   Margin:

    -   1: the manipulation is performed on rows

    -   2: the manipulation is performed on columns

    -   c(1,2): the manipulation is performed on rows and columns

-   FUN: which function to apply. Built functions like mean, median, sum, min, max and even user-defined functions

**Example**

```{r}
m1 <- matrix(C<-(1:10),nrow=5, ncol=6)
m1

a_m1 <- apply(m1, 2, sum)
a_m1
```

**lapply():** is useful for performing operations on list objects and returns a list object of same length of original set

```{r}
movies <- c("SPYDERMAN","BATMAN","VERTIGO","CHINATOWN")
movies_lower <-lapply(movies, tolower)
str(movies_lower)
```

**sapply() function:** sapply() function does the same job as lapply() function but returns a vector.

```{r}
dt <- cars
lmn_cars <- lapply(dt, min)
smn_cars <- sapply(dt, min)
lmn_cars
```

## 

OPTIONAL 1

We can create a custom function and apply to the data. For example, create a function to compute the average of the minimum and maximum of the vector.

```{r}
avg <- function(x) {  
  ( min(x) + max(x) ) / 2}
fcars <- sapply(dt, avg)
fcars
```

there are other functions:

**tapply()** It is a very useful function that lets you create a subset of a vector and then apply some functions to each of the subset

```{r}
data(iris)
tapply(iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Species, median)
```

**slice vector:** We can use lapply() or sapply() interchangeable to slice a data frame.

Let's create below_average() function to return a vector that only contains the values that are strictly above the average. Then we use lapply and sapply to slice the vector.

    dt <- cars
    below_ave <- function(x) {  
        ave <- mean(x) 
        return(x[x > ave])
    }
    dt_s<- sapply(dt, below_ave)
    dt_l<- lapply(dt, below_ave)
    identical(dt_s, dt_l)

-   compare both results with the identical()
